I’m a final-year B.Tech (CSE) student who loves building practical projects — especially Android apps and small web tools. I enjoy learning new languages and tools, solving problems, and turning ideas into working code. I also do early morning runs, enjoy anime, and like experimenting with food/coffee ☕.
